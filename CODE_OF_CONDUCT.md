# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

This project provides a Python client library for [Stash](https://stashapp.cc), a media organization and metadata management system. Given the nature of the Stash application, this project's discussions and documentation necessarily reference adult content metadata, database schemas, and technical implementations related to media organization.

We are committed to maintaining a **professional, respectful, and inclusive environment** for all contributors while acknowledging the technical domain of this project.

## Project Context

**Important Distinction:**

- ✅ **Appropriate:** Technical discussion of Stash's data models, metadata fields (performers, scenes, studios, tags, etc.), API implementation, GraphQL schema design, and feature development
- ❌ **Inappropriate:** Using the project as a platform for harassment, behavior that makes contributors uncomfortable, or sharing methods to bypass copyright protections or DRM

**This is a technical project about metadata systems and APIs.** Contributors should be able to discuss technical implementation details professionally without encountering harassment or inappropriate content.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

- **Professional Collaboration:** Approach discussions with technical rigor and professional courtesy
- **Respectful Disagreement:** Critique ideas and code, not people; assume good faith in technical discussions
- **Inclusive Language:** Use welcoming language; avoid assumptions about contributors' backgrounds or experience levels
- **Technical Focus:** Keep discussions focused on code, architecture, testing, and project goals
- **Clear Communication:** Provide context, examples, and rationale when proposing changes or reporting issues
- **Constructive Feedback:** Offer specific, actionable feedback in code reviews and discussions

### Unacceptable Behavior

- **Harassment:** Personal attacks, intimidation, stalking, or unwelcome attention of any kind
- **Discrimination:** Prejudiced language or actions based on identity, background, or personal characteristics
- **Content Distribution:** Using project channels to distribute, promote, or facilitate access to copyrighted material. **Note:** Linking to content sources for legitimate technical purposes (bug reproduction, metadata verification, API testing) is acceptable when necessary for technical discussion, but should be done professionally and contextually
- **Piracy Advocacy:** Sharing methods, tools, or techniques for bypassing copyright protections, DRM systems, or paywalls
- **Trolling:** Deliberately inflammatory, off-topic, or disruptive behavior
- **Privacy Violations:** Sharing others' private information without consent
- **Spam:** Unsolicited commercial content or repeated off-topic posts

## Domain-Appropriate Discussion

Given this project's purpose, the following are **explicitly permitted** as technical discussion:

- Database schema design for performer, scene, studio, and tag entities
- GraphQL query and mutation design for metadata operations
- API endpoint design and HTTP request/response formats
- Test data creation (using realistic but fictional metadata examples)
- Feature requests for metadata fields, filtering, search, and organization
- Documentation of Stash's API and data models
- Bug reports that include necessary context links for reproduction (when relevant and appropriate)

Contributors discussing these topics professionally are **not** violating this code of conduct.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **GitHub Issues:** For public discussion (preferred for technical disputes)
2. **Direct Contact:** Email github@jakan.co for confidential reports
3. **GitHub Moderation:** Use GitHub's built-in reporting tools for severe violations

### Response

Maintainers will:

- Review reports promptly and fairly
- Investigate reported behavior in context
- Take appropriate action, which may include:
  - Private discussion with involved parties
  - Public clarification of expected behavior
  - Temporary or permanent ban from the project

### Appeal

If you believe enforcement action was taken in error, contact github@jakan.co with:

- Description of the action taken
- Why you believe it was inappropriate
- Supporting context or evidence

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- Project repositories (code, issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project communication channels (if established)
- Public representation of the project

It **does not** apply to:

- Private communications between individuals
- Other projects or communities
- Technical discussion appropriate to this project's domain

## Attribution and License

This Code of Conduct is custom-written for this project, acknowledging its unique technical domain while maintaining professional standards.

Inspired by professional engineering codes of conduct with adaptations for metadata systems and API client libraries.

## Questions

If you're unsure whether something is appropriate:

- **Ask yourself:** "Is this about the technical implementation of metadata systems?"
- **When in doubt:** Focus on code, architecture, and technical problems
- **Need clarification?** Open a discussion or ask maintainers

## Summary

**Be professional. Be respectful. Focus on the code.**

This project has a specific technical purpose. Contributors should be able to discuss that purpose openly and professionally without encountering harassment or inappropriate content. Mutual respect and technical excellence are our shared goals.
